## üìò Overview

**Amikom Students Enumerator** is a proof-of-concept (PoC) Python tool created for **educational cybersecurity research**.
Its purpose was to demonstrate **mass enumeration and IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)** vulnerabilities found in the student photo system of **amikom.ac.id**, before the issue was patched.

This tool is **no longer functional** as the vulnerability has been mitigated by the system administrators.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality (Before Patch)

* Automated retrieval of student photo URLs
* Enumeration based on sequential student IDs
* Parallel download of all accessible photos
* Local storage for research and vulnerability validation

---

## üîí Security Disclosure Summary

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exposure (Mass Enumeration / IDOR)

**Root Cause:**
Predictable URL structure without authentication or access control.

**Impact:**

* Allowed bulk access to all student photos.
* Risk of personal data leakage (names, photos).
* Potential misuse for **phishing, impersonation, or social engineering**.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Server Overload (Denial of Service)

**Root Cause:**
Excessive concurrent requests generated by multi-threaded enumeration.

**Impact:**

* Could degrade web server performance.
* Temporary service unavailability for legitimate users.
* Affected stability of shared hosting resources.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical and Legal Notice

This tool was **never intended for exploitation**.
It was created for **academic cybersecurity study**, to demonstrate how **improper access control** can lead to mass data exposure.

If you are a system administrator or developer:

* Always validate access control for media files.
* Avoid predictable identifiers in URLs.
* Implement authentication or token-based access for sensitive assets.
